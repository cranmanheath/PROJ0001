This is the RepRapPro version of Marlin.

Modifications mainly be Jean-Marc and Adrian

The core Marlin code in the Marlin directory is stable and is our standard
release firmware for all RepRapPro RepRap machines.

For instructions see:

RepRapPro Mendel: http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRapPro_Mendel_maintenance

RepRapPro Huxley: http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRapPro_Huxley_maintenance

Code in the Slave directory is under development.  This will drive a slave
controller (with the core Marlin code on the master controller) to control
multiple extruders.
